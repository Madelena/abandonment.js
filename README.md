# abandonment.js
An art installation tackling the fear of abandonment.

It uses webcam.js to capture the audiences every 5 seconds, and then sends the image to Microsoft Cognitive Services Face API to determine if a face is present.  The presence of a face will change the emotional scores of the program.  When the scores hit a level of 'despair', it will print out a love letter to the face it had last seen.

In the art installation, the webcam is set up in an old doll, while there is also a printer and a shredder.  Anything that gets printed out will go on a brief moment of display and remembrance, only to be fed right into the shredder for the memory to be destroyed.
